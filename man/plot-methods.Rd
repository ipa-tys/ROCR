\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class \code{performance}}

\item{y}{not used}

\item{...}{Optional graphical parameters to adjust different components of
the performance plot. Parameters are directed to their target component by
prefixing them with the name of the component (\code{component.parameter},
e.g. \code{text.cex}). The following components are available:
\code{xaxis}, \code{yaxis}, \code{coloraxis}, \code{box} (around the
plotting region), \code{points}, \code{text}, \code{plotCI} (error bars),
\code{boxplot}. The names of these components are influenced by the R
functions that are used to create them. Thus, \code{par(component)} can be
used to see which parameters are available for a given component (with the
expection of the three axes; use \code{par(axis)} here). To adjust the
canvas or the performance curve(s), the standard \code{plot} parameters can
be used without any prefix.}

\item{avg}{If the performance object describes several curves (from
cross-validation runs or bootstrap evaluations of one particular method),
the curves from each of the runs can be averaged. Allowed values are
\code{none} (plot all curves separately), \code{horizontal} (horizontal
averaging), \code{vertical} (vertical averaging), and \code{threshold}
(threshold (=cutoff) averaging). Note that while threshold averaging is
always feasible, vertical and horizontal averaging are not well-defined if
the graph cannot be represented as a function x->y and y->x, respectively.}

\item{spread.estimate}{When curve averaging is enabled, the variation around
the average curve can be visualized as standard error bars
(\code{stderror}), standard deviation bars (\code{stddev}), or by using box
plots (\code{boxplot}). Note that the function \code{plotCI}, which is used
internally by ROCR to draw error bars, might raise a warning if the spread
of the curves at certain positions is 0.}

\item{spread.scale}{For \code{stderror} or \code{stddev}, this is a scalar
factor to be multiplied with the length of the standard error/deviation
bar. For example, under normal assumptions, \code{spread.scale=2} can be
used to get approximate 95\% confidence intervals.}

\item{show.spread.at}{For vertical averaging, this vector determines the x
positions for which the spread estimates should be visualized. In contrast,
for horizontal and threshold averaging, the y positions and cutoffs are
determined, respectively. By default, spread estimates are shown at 11
equally spaced positions.}

\item{colorize}{This logical determines whether the curve(s) should be
colorized according to cutoff.}

\item{colorize.palette}{If curve colorizing is enabled, this determines the
color palette onto which the cutoff range is mapped.}

\item{colorkey}{If true, a color key is drawn into the 4\% border
region (default of \code{par(xaxs)} and \code{par(yaxs)}) of the
plot. The color key visualizes the mapping from cutoffs to colors.}

\item{colorkey.relwidth}{Scalar between 0 and 1 that determines the
fraction of the 4\% border region that is occupied by the colorkey.}

\item{colorkey.pos}{Determines if the colorkey is drawn vertically at
the \code{right} side, or horizontally at the \code{top} of the
plot.}

\item{print.cutoffs.at}{This vector specifies the cutoffs which should
be printed as text along the curve at the corresponding curve positions.}

\item{cutoff.label.function}{By default, cutoff annotations along the curve
or at the color key are rounded to two decimal places before printing.
Using a custom \code{cutoff.label.function}, any other transformation can
be performed on the cutoffs instead (e.g. rounding with different precision
or taking the logarithm).}

\item{downsampling}{ROCR can efficiently compute most performance measures
even for data sets with millions of elements. However, plotting of large
data sets can be slow and lead to PS/PDF documents of considerable size. In
that case, performance curves that are indistinguishable from the original
can be obtained by using only a fraction of the computed performance
values. Values for downsampling between 0 and 1 indicate the fraction of
the original data set size to which the performance object should be
downsampled, integers above 1 are interpreted as the actual number of
performance values to which the curve(s) should be downsampled.}

\item{add}{If \code{TRUE}, the curve(s) is/are added to an already existing
plot; otherwise a new plot is drawn.}

# plotting a ROC curve:
library(ROCR)
data(ROCR.simple)
pred <- prediction( ROCR.simple$predictions, ROCR.simple$labels )

perf
plot( perf )
