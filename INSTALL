INSTALLATION INSTRUCTION FOR ROCR:
----------------------------------

If you read this, you've probably done too much already:
it is not necessary to unpack the package. R has a very
simple package installation mechanism:

-----------
R CMD INSTALL ROCR_1.0-4.tar.gz

Windows:
--------
From the 'Packages' menu choose the item
'Install package(s) from local zip files'. 
Select the ROCR zip file, and you're done.

* Have fun!
